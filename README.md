Welcome to my profile! I'm Web Developer from **[Dhaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka), [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh).** My main areas of expertise are front-end and full-stack web development. I am passionate about trying out new technologies. Thank you for visiting my repo. I hope you find the projects here interesting. If you have any questions or comments, please reach out to me.

Web Developer with 1+ years of experience, I have worked with NEXT JS, REACT, NODE JS, and MongoDB for database management. I am flexible in working with any JavaScript-based project.

I'm currently focused on various projects for my company. One of my main projects is building a web app with Next.js. I've made it look better and run faster by following best practices, which boosted its speed by 20%.

At LetsDunch, I was a front-end developer who built and updated UI components with React.js and Tailwind CSS. I worked with other teams to connect APIs that added more features and data to the web app. Some of the features I helped with were booking and rescheduling meetings, updating expert profiles, and making over some old pages. I also did a lot of analysis and documentation for the project. Besides that, I fixed bugs and regularly improved the system's performance.
